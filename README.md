# CypressAssessment
This is an assessment to show the cool and amazing things you can do with Cypress.

Awardco assessment for cypress.
To get started you will need to open terminal after cloning and use "npm install" after you have all the packages downloaded as well as cypress run 'npx cypress open'

**Purpose**
I chose to test The Get A Demo page I chose this page because it is important that you can gain new customers and verify that they are able to fill out information correctly. 


I also created additional pages for future testing that would be benifical to test. These pages should be seperated when testing with cypress to avoid any long running tests and dependencies.
